[asi_mackeyglass.ipynb](asi_mackeyglass.ipynb):  pipeline for Mackey-Glass time series prediction

[asi_mackeyglass_NL_MC.ipynb](asi_mackeyglass_NL_MC.ipynb): estimation of non-linearity (NL) and memory capcity (MC) of the reservoir system based on Makey-Glass prediction

### Setup
To run the notebook files, an ipython kernel need to be built from a virtual environment where [flatspin](https://flatspin.gitlab.io/2.5.1/installation.html) is installed.
```
ipython kernel install --user --name=[asi_venv]
```
Then in Jupyter notebook, select the appropriate kernel [asi_venv].
